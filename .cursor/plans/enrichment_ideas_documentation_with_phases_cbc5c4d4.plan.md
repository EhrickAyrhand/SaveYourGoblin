# Plan: Create Enrichment Ideas Documentation with Phases

## Objective

Create a comprehensive Markdown file (`ENRICHMENT_IDEAS.md`) documenting all 47 enrichment ideas for SaveYourGoblin, organized into implementation phases.

## Phase Organization Strategy

Ideas will be grouped into phases based on:

- **Phase 1 (Quick Wins)**: Low complexity, high value, minimal dependencies
- **Phase 2 (Core Enhancements)**: Medium complexity, builds on existing features
- **Phase 3 (Advanced Features)**: Higher complexity, new functionality
- **Phase 4 (Community & Integration)**: Requires infrastructure and external integrations
- **Phase 5 (Polish & Scale)**: Optimization, gamification, and advanced UX

## File Structure

The markdown file will include:

1. **Header** - Title, introduction, and overview
2. **Table of Contents** - Quick navigation by phase
3. **Phase Overview** - Summary of each phase
4. **Phased Ideas** - All 47 ideas organized into 5 phases:

- **Phase 1: Quick Wins** (~10-12 ideas)
- **Phase 2: Core Enhancements** (~10-12 ideas)
- **Phase 3: Advanced Features** (~10-12 ideas)
- **Phase 4: Community & Integration** (~8-10 ideas)
- **Phase 5: Polish & Scale** (~5-7 ideas)

5. **Each Idea Entry** will include:

- Phase number
- Number and title
- Brief description
- Estimated complexity (Low/Medium/High)
- Dependencies (if any)

6. **Implementation Roadmap** - Summary and recommendations

## Phase Breakdown
